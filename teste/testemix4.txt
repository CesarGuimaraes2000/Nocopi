I pile on the candy
It's such a pretty sight
It makes the food taste dandy
But my tummy hurts all night
I'll put in some ingredients
But keep the rest for me
I'm not just disobedient
I'm careful, can't you see?
It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake
If the way is hazy
You gotta do the cooking by the book
You know you can't be lazy!
Never use a messy recipe
The cake will end up crazy
If you do the cooking by the book
Then you'll have a cake
We gotta have it made
You know that I love cake
Finally, it's time to make a cake
Making food is just like science (Bake a cake)
With tools that blend and baste (Bake a cake)
And every fun appliance
Gives the food a different taste
It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake
If the way is hazy
You gotta do the cooking by the book
You know you can't be lazy!
Never use a messy recipe
The cake will end up crazy
If you do the cooking by the book
Then you'll have a cake
We gotta have it made
You know that I love cake
Finally, it's time to make a cake
We gotta have it made
You know that I love cake
Finally, it's time to make a–
You gotta do the cooking by the book
Cake
Well, Seymour, I made it- despite your directions. Ah. Superintendent Chalmers. Welcome.

I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon.

Yeah. Oh, egads! My roast is ruined. But what if I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Delightfully devilish, Seymour. Ah- Skinner with his crazy explanations The superintendent's gonna need his medication When he hears Skinner's lame exaggerations There'll be trouble in town tonight Seymour! Superintendent, I was just- uh, just stretching my calves on the windowsill. Isometric exercise. Care to join me? Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour? Uh- Oh. That isn't smoke. It's steam. Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmm. Steamed clams. Whew. Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouthwatering hamburgers. I thought we were having steamed clams. D'oh, no. I said steamed hams. That's what I call hamburgers. You call hamburgers steamed hams? Yes. It's a regional dialect.

Uh-huh. Uh, what region? - Uh, upstate New York. Really. Well, I'm from Utica, and I've never heard anyone use the phrase "steamed hams. 

" Oh, not in Utica. No. It's an Albany expression. I see. You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger. Oh, no. Patented Skinner burgers. Old family recipe.

In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a programming technique used to create new classes (whose instances are called objects) based on classes that are already defined. The concept of inheritance was first introduced in 1967 with the Simula language. These new classes, known as subclasses or derived classes, receive (or inherit) the characteristics and behaviors of the existing classes, which are known as parent or base classes. Its main purpose is to enable the reuse of existing code with minimal or no changes. Inheritance supports the organization of information in programming languages through classification. Classification is a powerful method of processing information, fundamental to human learning through generalization (knowledge about specific entities can be applied to a larger group when a relationship of belonging exists) and cognitive efficiency (it is not necessary to store all information for each individual entity, only its distinctive details). Inheritance is sometimes referred to as generalization, because “is-a” relationships express a hierarchy among classes of objects. For example, a “tool” is a generalization of “hammer,” “screwdriver,” “wrench,” and others. One can think of a tool as an abstraction of hammer, screwdriver, etc. Likewise, since a hammer is a tool (i.e., a hammer is-a tool), it can naturally inherit all properties common to all tools, such as being used to perform work. A key benefit of inheritance is that modules with similar interfaces can share large amounts of code, simplifying the program’s structure. Inheritance also relates to another concept called polymorphism, which allows multiple sections of code to be managed through a shared control mechanism.
Inheritance is generally implemented by overriding (replacing) one or more methods provided by the parent class or by adding new methods to those already offered by the parent. However, complex inheritance, or its use in immature designs, can result in what is known as the Yo-yo problem.

For steamed hams.

Yes. Yes. And you call them steamed hams despite the fact that they are obviously grilled. Ye- You know, the- One thing I should- - Excuse me for one second.

Of course. Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all. I'm pooped. Yes. I should be- Good Lord! What is happening in there? - Aurora borealis.

Uh- Aurora borealis at this time of year at this time of day in this part of the country localized entirely within your kitchen? - Yes.

May I see it? No. Seymour. ! The house is on fire. ! No, Mother. It's just the northern lights. Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow but I must say you steam a good ham.

The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
