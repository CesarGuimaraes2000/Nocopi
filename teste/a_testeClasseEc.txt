The unequal distribution of these forms of capital across different economic classes is a primary driver of persistent inequality.

For the wealthy, inheritance acts as a powerful engine for the preservation and accumulation of wealth. Large bequests and gifts can ensure that future generations maintain their affluent status, creating what some sociologists refer to as a "glass floor" that prevents them from falling down the socioeconomic ladder. This concentration of wealth at the top is further compounded by the fact that the wealthy have greater access to financial expertise and investment opportunities that allow their inherited assets to grow at a faster rate.

For the middle class, inheritance can be a significant factor in achieving financial stability. A modest inheritance can make the difference in being able to afford a home in a desirable neighborhood, fund a child's education, or secure a comfortable retirement. However, as the costs of housing and education continue to rise, the impact of these smaller inheritances may be diminishing.

For those in lower economic classes, the lack of substantial inheritance presents a significant barrier to upward mobility. Without the cushion of inherited wealth, individuals are more likely to face financial instability, accumulate debt, and have limited access to the educational and professional opportunities that are crucial for economic advancement. The absence of intergenerational wealth transfer makes it incredibly challenging to break the cycle of poverty.
